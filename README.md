# dash_on_heroku_boilerplate
A simple boilerplate for beginners to uploaded their dashboards made with `dash` in `python` to *Heroku*.

### Notes
In `your_project_name/Procfile`, it's necessary use the `.py` file name in `web: gunicorn app:server`.  
Also, make sure to create a local repo before deploying your app to Heroku.

Cheers!
